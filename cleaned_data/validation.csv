The deficiency in performing these inspections was primarily due to negligence by the Chief Officer (C/O), who overlooked the less frequently used and less visible equipment. Rollers of forward and aft mooring station are used more frequently and thus conduct more regular maintenance, whereas the rollers near the hatch covers on the port or starboard side are used less often and are consequently less visible and more likely to be overlooked. This oversight resulted from an assumption that less frequently used equipment required less frequent checks, a misjudgment likely influenced by prioritization issues where more frequently used equipment is maintained more rigorously. The inconsistency in maintenance practices arises from a lack of strict enforcement of company inspection procedure, and inadequate training and accountability measures that fail to ensure uniform maintenance across all shipboard equipment. Additionally, the Master did not verify that the company procedures were being thoroughly implemented, displaying complacency in relying on the C/O's inspections and execution."

The deficiency was attributed to an oversight by the senior officers during inspections. To address this, the Company Policy mandates reeducating the staff and enhancing their inspection effectiveness. The in-house training team has been instructed to emphasize inspection procedures during briefings. The superintendent has briefed the senior officers on the following points: The coaming's primary function is to prevent water from entering the cargo hold. A crack can compromise this seal, allowing water ingress during heavy weather, which can damage the cargo. The coaming also provides structural support to the hatch cover. A crack can weaken this support, increasing the risk of further structural damage or failure, especially under stress. Depending on the crack's severity, immediate repair or replacement may be necessary, which could lead to operational delays and disruptions to the vessel's schedule. Regular inspections are essential to identify and address such issues. Prompt repair of the crack is crucial to prevent more significant problems and costly repairs in the future. The superintendent and auditor will verify the above points during their visits.","The crack in the coaming went unnoticed during the routine deck inspection. ClassNK was notified immediately, and repairs were carried out according to their recommendations. An application was also sent out to schedule a survey at the next port of call."

During uptake of ballast water in Guinea (24/02/2024 - 09/03/2024) the ballast water treatment system was bypassed due to clogging of the filter. Later on, ballast water was exchanged at sea. During this exchange, once again, the ballast water treatment system has not been used. This way it was impossible to discharge the exchanged ballast water in a correct way (first, the ballast must be treated (during uptake), afterward the ballast must be neutralized (during discharge)).

The meeting emphasised the critical importance of promptly addressing maintenance needs for any equipment related to the Safety System. The observation has been included in the Quarterly List of Observations circulated across the Fleet vessels with the aim of raising awareness and avoiding recurrence.","Priming units of the General Service pumps 1 & 2 were not in position at the time of the inspection. The vessel's crew negligently handled the replacement of the priming units before reaching the loading port of St. Eustatius. Upon arrival, the vessel immediately berthed, compelling the crew to prioritize all pre-arrival tasks, thus postponing the replacement of the priming units. According to their initial design, the vessel is provided by two (2) fire and general service pumps, a type of vertical centrifugal pump, equipped with priming units. The purpose of the priming units is to remove air from the suction and discharge casings of the fire pump. This action reduces the pressure inside the pump casing below atmospheric pressure, creating the necessary vacuum and ensuring the pump's sufficient suction pressure. The priming units, along with the pump's components, are subject to periodical inspection and maintenance in accordance with the company's Planned Maintenance System, which is fully harmonized with the manufacturer's instructions. The latest general inspection and overhauling of the priming units was on the 22nd of May 2022, as per the below screenshot, which is extracted from the Vessel's PMS database. The efficiency of the Fire pumps and their attached priming units is constantly evaluated during the monthly fire drills and the weekly inspections of all safety equipment. During the latest fire drill onboard, the engine crew noticed a minor reduction in the priming units' performance and notified the responsible Technical superintendent. With authorisation from the head office, the vessel's crew was instructed to proceed proactively with the replacement of the priming units by spare units available onboard. The vessel's crew negligently handled the replacement of the priming units before reaching the loading port of St. Eustatius. Upon arrival, the vessel immediately berthed, compelling the crew to prioritize all pre-arrival tasks, thus postponing the replacement of the priming units."
